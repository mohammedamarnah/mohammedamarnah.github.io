Convex Human is a blog that discusses different ideas related to Computer Science, Mathematics, System Design and Architecture.

## Who is Convex Human?
I am Mohammad Amarnah, a Software Engineer and a lifetime student. My interest in computers started at a young age. Programming led my interest in several other fields and science in general - and continues to do so.
I am fond of functional programming and design, a lover of Clojure/lisp, and interested in doing everything in a functional manner. I like Algorithms and sometimes like to compete in online competitive programming competitions.

## Professional Experience
### [Angi](https://angi.com/)
#### Software Engineer II
#### April 2022 - Present
* Engineered and managed microservices for storing usersâ€™ communication preferences, seamlessly integrating with marketing tools (Iterable, Responsys) to facilitate efficient customer-provider connections.
* Designed and implemented a large-scale data migration pipeline that transferred 100M+ user records from disparate legacy sources to a streamlined Postgres database, ensuring data accuracy and continuity.
* Led the design of a modular schema for storing diverse user communication preferences, enabling easy integration of various communication types (marketing, transactional) within an extensible framework.
* Resolved complex data inconsistencies across multiple sources by conducting meticulous analysis and utilizing tools like Snowflake, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

### [Edraak](https://www.edraak.org/en/)
#### Senior Software Engineer (Contractor)
#### January 2022 - July 2022
* Introduced optimizations on the database and application level that improved the performance by at least 30%.
* Refactored the Learning Management System by optimizing the number of database queries it makes and combining multiple existing queries with bulk database actions.
* Cleanup application models to a more modular, inheritable, and abstract definition that allows a cleaner, more readable code base.

### [Expedia Group Inc.](https://www.expedia.com/)
#### Software Development Engineer II
#### May 2021 - July 2021

### [Jawaker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jawaker-games-friends/id870092728?mt=8)
#### Software Engineer
#### February 2018 - May 2021
* Designed and implemented web systems in a distributed service-oriented architecture, using a stack that included: Clojure, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Cassandra, and other technologies.
* Designed and engineered a scalable matchmaking service that was used to handle matching millions of users in real-time.
* Collaborated with the team on scaling the architecture to handle 5x the traffic during quarantine.
