Convex Human is a blog that discusses different ideas related to Computer Science, Mathematics, System Design and Architecture.

## Who is Convex Human?
My name is Mohammed Amarnah. I am a Computer Science graduate, a Software Engineer, and a lifetime student. My interest in Computer Science started when I was 14 years old. Programming led my interest to several other fields, and science in general. I was a participant of several science fairs and programming competitions ever since I was in high school. From robotics, to scientific research and competitive programming competitions, all curated a deeper appreciation of science and math in me.

## Professional Experience
### Jawaker
#### Software Engineer
#### February 2018 - Present
* Designed and implemented several services in a distributed service-oriented architecture, using a stack that included: Clojure, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Cassandra, and other technologies.
* Developed a strong understanding of both service-oriented and microservice architectures, along with how and when to use them.
* Collaborated with the team on scaling our architecture to handle 5x the traffic during quarantine.
* Led the technical design and implementation of several games and products.

### Mixed Dimensions
#### Research and Development Engineering Intern
#### March 2017 - October 2017
* Worked on 3D model rendering and computational geometry algorithms using C++ with openCV.
* Developed a good acquaintance with the CUDA library for optimally rendering 3D models using GPUs.
* Assisted the robotics team working on a robotic arm to automate the process of painting 3D models using ROS and Gazebo.
