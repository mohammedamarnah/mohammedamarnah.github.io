Convex Human is a blog that discusses different ideas related to Computer Science, Mathematics, System Design and Architecture.

## Who is Convex Human?
My name is Mohammed Amarnah. I am a Computer Science graduate, a Software Engineer, and a lifetime student. My interest in Computer Science started when I was 14 years old. Programming led my interest to several other fields, and science in general. I was a participant of several science fairs and programming competitions ever since I was in high school. From robotics, to scientific research and competitive programming competitions, all curated a deeper appreciation of science and math in me.
